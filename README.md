# Note Taker

## Description
This is a simple app that allows the user to write, save, read, and delete information they store in notes.  It can be used as a scratch pad to keep track of thoughts, grocery lists, book recommendations, or anything else they wish to complete in the near future. 

The UI is minimal, with simple buttons to help the user take and review notes quickly and easily.

## Instructions
This app is browser-based, and a deployed link can be found at https://sams-note-taker-app.herokuapp.com/.

On the back-end, all that needs to be installed is Express.  Then, make sure to run an "npm i" command to install built-in the dependencies of path, fs, and util.

## Usage
The use of this note taker application is quite straight-forward.  Once you arrive on the landing page, click on the "Get Started" button to move to the notes page.

Once on the notes page, you follow the steps below to create, save, view, and delete your notes: 
- Enter a note and a title into the text areas provided.
- Look for the save icon in the upper right-hand corner.  Click it to save your note once completed.
- You will then see your note appear in the column to the left.  You can click on it to view. You can also your existing notes by clicking on the red trash icon.
- When you're ready to add a new note, click the "+" icon in the upper right-hand corner of the screen.
